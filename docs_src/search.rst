Search Commits
==============

There are three ways to search and locate a commit.

* Searching a commit by commit metadata.  This particular search is still
  quite primitive and will be updated in the near future.
* Searching a commit by branch information.
* Searching a commit by tag.

All the searches can take either a partial name or a RegEx to filter the
commits.

The tables can have additional columns listed by right clicking on the
table header, and updating the selected columns.
